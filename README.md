This project originates from a competition that was hosted on Kaggle. 

The following are the relevant details for this competition: -
1) Competition name: -     Optiver-trading at close
2) Competition duration: - Sep 20, 2023 - Dec 20, 2023
3) Competition URL: - 	   https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-trading-at-the-close
4) Additional knowledge: - https://www.kaggle.com/code/tomforbes/optiver-trading-at-the-close-introduction

The project repository contains the following artefacts: -
1) ModelArchitecture.xlsx: - contains a performance comparison of various models.
2) train.csv: - 	     contains the training data.
3) usstockpredictor.ipynb: - This is the jupyter notebook that contains the python code that creates and trains the 			     model.

The initial version of the model, uploaded here on Github, was developed during the competition. The model
performance was found to be inadequate. The focus of this project is to make suitable adjustments to the RNN
model to improve it further.
